Use of declarative and functional programming language Haskell
to build algorithms and solve optimization problems.

Problems:
Bin Packing - NP-Complete optimization problem equivalent to subset sum problem
Super String - NP-Complete optimization problem - see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_common_supersequence_problem


Four files included:
BinPacking.hs - Simple algorithm to pick between two bins
SuperString.hs - Simple algorithm to pick between superstrings
Graph.hs - Module made to build state space graphs applied to optimize the problems
Algorithm.hs - Library made to create optimization algorithms
